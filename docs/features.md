# What's Different?

There are many LeetCode solution repositories on GitHub. In this article, we would briefly discuss the aspects that may 
make this repository unique.

## No ACM, No Competitive Programming

The target audience of this repository is everyone. Well, strictly speaking, you at least need to have some basic knowledge of Java. However, [Yunpeng](https://github.com/yunpengn/) is neither a competitive programmer nor a partcipant of any ACM contests. Thus, the code presented in this repository would attempt to be as comprehensible as possible. We try to make sure everyone can understand every single line of code.

## Clear, Precise, Concise

This is the general guideline for the coding style of this repository. Whenver making any decision, we strive make sure the code is clear, precise and concise, in that order of importantce. We believe good coding styling is the key to correct and elegant solutions.
